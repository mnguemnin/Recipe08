        description: 'A classic Italian pasta dish made with eggs, cheese, pancetta, and black pepper.',
       instructions: `Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti and cook until al dente. Reserve about 1 cup of pasta water before draining.
       In a pan, cook the diced pancetta until crispy. Remove from heat and set aside.
       In a bowl, whisk together eggs, grated Pecorino Romano cheese, and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper.
       Add the cooked pasta to the pan with pancetta. Toss to combine.
       Remove the pan from heat and quickly pour in the egg and cheese mixture, tossing the pasta vigorously to coat. The heat from the pasta will cook the eggs and create a creamy sauce. If needed, add reserved pasta water to achieve desired consistency.
       Serve immediately with additional grated cheese and black pepper on top.
